Hello!

I make this document to explain some things.

I tried to find a font family similar to your logo and even searched for it on your website. In the end I used Montserrat since I did not recibe anything about it.

For the user image, I used this lovely lady since I did not get any picture either (in case you are wondering why that's different)

I am sorry if I got some things mixed up, for example I used px and em for some things. I do not know if I did it right, but I used em for font size because some users can change the font of their browser.

I am sorry if it's not exactly the same and I hope you don't get too scared of some weird thing about the code, but I had a lot of fun doing this code test and it helped me remember some things.

Thanks for the opportunity and I appreciate any feedback.
